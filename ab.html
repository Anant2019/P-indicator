<h3>The Wheels of History</h3><br/>
<p>Pune?s transportation system has developed gradually over the years. In the early 1940s, tangas were the only mode of transport. It was Pune Nagarpalika that conceived the idea of coming up with a public transport service. The dream took shape when the RTO permitted and M|s Silver Jubilee Motors was assigned the task. Back then there were just 4 routes with 20 buses plying across them. The fleet grew to 46 by 1948.</p><br/>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Formation of PMT</p><br/>
<p>Pune Nagarpalika, in its new Avatar as Pune Municipal Corporation, took charge of the bus service in 1950. Pune Municipal Transport (PMT) was thus started in compliance with the BPMC Act of 1949. The number of buses now stood at 57 and they were plying across 14 routes. By 1960, these figures had gone further up.</p><br/>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Formation of PCMT</p><br/>
<p>It was on 4th March 1974 that Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Transport (PCMT) came into being. Their first depot started off with 8 buses plying between Pimpri village and Bhosari. The second one came up in 1988 at Gavhane Vasti, Bhosari and later shifted to Dhawade Vasti in Bhosari itself. By 1988, PCMT had 101 buses plying across 13 routes and 45 schedules.</p><br/>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Formation of PMPML</p><br/>
<p>It was on 19th October 2007 that PMPML came into being as PMT and PCMT merged into a single entity. Ever since, PMPML has been dedicated towards providing commuters with a safe, affordable and convenient transportation service.</p>                                    </div>
